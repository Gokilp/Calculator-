# Calculator Application-

I am  developing a calculator application using the C programming language!

It shows that you have a good understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming.

My calculator application is designed to perform
basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows users to input numbers using the keyboard and displays the result of their calculations on the screen. This simple yet powerful tool is useful for a wide range of applications, including budgeting, scientific calculations, and everyday arithmetic.

In developing this application, you demonstrated your proficiency in C programming concepts such as variables, data types, functions, conditional statements, and loops. Your code is well-organized, easy to read, and efficient, making it a great example of best practices in programming
